# Template maintenance

This guide belongs to the WebApp-Skull source repository only. Generated projects
keep application code, tests, CI and documentation. They exclude this directory,
generation scripts and their tests, the distribution workflow, template commands
and archive-only dependencies.

Install the source repository dependencies with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
before running the commands below.

## Language profiles and archives

The maintainer repository offers three profiles:

| Profile        | Interface and email | Public routes                  | Documentation |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------- |
| `en`           | English             | `/sign-in`                     | English       |
| `fr`           | French              | `/connexion`                   | French        |
| `multilingual` | English + French    | `/en/sign-in`, `/fr/connexion` | English       |

```bash
pnpm template:create -- --profile en --output output/english-app
pnpm template:create -- --profile fr --output output/french-app
pnpm template:create -- --profile multilingual --output output/bilingual-app
pnpm template:check
pnpm template:archives
```

The default profile is `en`. The multilingual profile defaults to English;
the URL selects the active language. `scripts/template-profiles.mjs` defines
the three profiles for generation, archives and CI. There are no independent
documentation options or arbitrary locale combinations.

Generation checks message and route coverage before creating output, creates
missing parent directories and refuses existing output directories. It never
reads real environment files or connects to a database. Generated projects omit
source packs, template tooling, Git history, dependencies and caches. Install
dependencies normally before building. ZIPs are written to `output/templates`
and contain the project files directly, including required dotfiles; a Git clone
includes all source packs. `pnpm template:archives -- --profile fr --output output/dist`
generates only the French ZIP. The command uses Node.js and pnpm and requires no external
archive utility. Existing project directories and ZIP files are never overwritten.

Internal routes stay English. Update `packages/i18n/messages/en.json` for source
messages and `template/locales/fr/messages.json` / `routes.json` for French
messages and public paths. Keep message keys and internal route coverage aligned.
French application documentation lives under `template/locales/fr`.

## Ownership and generated files

`scripts/template-profiles.mjs` owns the three supported profiles.
`template-generator.mjs` validates catalogs, routes and documentation before
creating output. `template-files.mjs` selects and copies source files.
`template-archives.mjs` packages a freshly generated project before installation.

The generator removes `template:*` commands and `fflate` from the generated
manifest. It refreshes the copied lockfile with pnpm in offline, lockfile-only
mode, with lifecycle scripts disabled. No dependencies are installed and unused
lockfile entries are pruned. Install source dependencies first so pnpm's offline
metadata is available; generation fails if the lockfile cannot be refreshed.

Application documentation is shared with the output (French documents replace
English ones for the French profile). A `<!-- template-maintainers:start -->` /
`<!-- template-maintainers:end -->` block marks the source README's maintenance
link; the generator omits this block. Keep distribution procedures in this guide,
not in application documentation.

## Distribution validation

The template workflow checks the generator and all three profiles. It creates
source ZIPs, extracts them, then runs `pnpm check`, integration and E2E in each
active language against the extracted projects. The ZIPs themselves are uploaded,
without an outer archive. Application CI is copied unchanged.

## Publishing template releases

PRs and `Run workflow` perform validation and provide downloadable artifacts.
Only pushing a `v*` tag publishes a release, after all three profiles succeed.
Choose a new version on the intended commit, normally the merged `main`:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The example version must be unused. The release contains `webapp-skull-en.zip`,
`webapp-skull-fr.zip` and `webapp-skull-multilingual.zip`. Download those assets;
GitHub's automatic `Source code` archives contain the maintainer repository.

Only the tag publication job has repository write access. It verifies the remote
tag exists, downloads the tested ZIPs, checks archive integrity, creates a draft,
uploads all assets, then publishes it with generated release notes. A failed
upload leaves a draft rather than publishing an incomplete release. Existing
releases are not overwritten; inspect an existing draft before retrying a failed
publication. No npm package is published.
